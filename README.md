This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in assembly language programming: array out-of-bounds access. The `bug.asm` file shows code that is vulnerable to this issue, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version.  Understanding how to avoid this error is crucial for writing robust and reliable assembly code.  This example uses x86 assembly.
