mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4] ; This instruction assumes that ecx is a valid index into the array pointed to by ebx.  If ecx is too large or negative, this will lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the allocated array, causing a segmentation fault or other unexpected behavior.  This is a common error when dealing with array indexing in assembly language.  The programmer must ensure that ecx is within the valid range before performing the memory access.
